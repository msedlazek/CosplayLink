# CosplayLink
Wearable app that will connect via Raspberry Pi to an array of end point devices. 

Our target audience is the cosplay community, larp community, as well as the comic book communities.

USER EXPERIENCE:
When a user opens the mobile app, they will see a menu with a series of buttons that are labelled according to what end point devices they are attached to. The buttons will have a generic sequence associated with them. So button A will activate lights while button B will activate sounds. Other buttons will have combinations of devices and different sequences of when the devices activate. This is the end of where the app functions. The next part is on the on board computer processing the request from the app itself. 

DATABASE:
As it currently stands, the app will not make use of a database simply because the process only requires one input from the user and the responses are pre-built in. In the future, when user authentication becomes needed, a database will be employed. 

USER ACQUISITION:
The idea in getting our first few users is to market directly to the cosplay communities. Comic Con provides an excellent opportunity to reach out directly to potential users. The Replica Prop Forum is another venue that can be used to market the app. Also, direct marketing within larp communities will gain users as well.

BASIC FLOW SKETCH:

APP:
-Button 1   ---->   Recieves Input From User ------> On-Board CPU Generates Response ------> End Point Devices Activate.
